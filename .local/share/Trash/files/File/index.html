        Fire has been a primary tool for<a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&q=mankind&oq=mankind&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2387j1j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target_blank>
        mankind</a> for <strong>thousands</strong> of years.  We have all used it in some
        time in our live in some manner.  Fire has been used for light, heat,
         and protection.  Fire can be both, a life <i>saver</i> and a life <i>taker</i>.  
         But no matter how destructive fire can be, humanity will always 
         continue to use it.

        We, as humans, have always depended on fire for survival. We hav use it to cook
        our food, warm our houses, give use light.  It is only in this 
        Modern age where we are not so reliant on it.  But even then most houses still
        use gas stoves instead of electric to heat our food, many still have fire places
        alongside their heaters.  So no matter how advanced we get, fire will always
        remain a part of our live.
